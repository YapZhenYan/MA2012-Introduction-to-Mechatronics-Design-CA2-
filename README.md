**Project Objective: To create a mechatronics solution to provide a service (sales, waiting, reception, guide, etc.) with minimal human-to-human contact.**

**Project Theme: Automated Contactless Solution**

**Solution: Smartevator**

Purpose: Automated contactless elevator via Bluetooth signal using the Bluetooth terminal. Elevator will also be sanitised when there is no one presence in the elevator

**Sensors Used and its purpose**

1. Ultrasonic Sensor: Detect the person and call the lift
2. Green LED: Light up when lift is successfully called or triggered
3. Stepper Motor: Movement of elevator
4. LCD: Display floor level
5. Buzzer and Servo Motor: Reflects the status of the door (opening or closing)
6. Force Sensor: Detect if people are in the elevator
7. RED LED: Light up duirng sanitisation in the lift
8. Bluetooth Modules
